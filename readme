Your file isn’t rendering correctly in Markdown because:

1. **The folder structure block (`furniture-store/ ...`) isn’t inside triple backticks** → Without them, GitHub treats it as plain text and won’t preserve alignment.
2. **Some code blocks for commands don’t have proper opening and closing backticks with the language specified** — for example, `bash` is written as plain text, not inside \`\`\`bash.
3. **Extra blank lines and stray quotes** at the top and bottom can break rendering.

Here’s your corrected and cleanly formatted version:

## 🤖 Chatbot Integration

The chatbot is built using **Python (TensorFlow, NLTK, Keras)** and is integrated via API endpoints in Express. It helps users check order status, availability, and other FAQs directly on the site.

## 🙌 Acknowledgements

* Firebase Authentication
* Tailwind CSS
* MongoDB Atlas
* TensorFlow for chatbot model
* OpenAI ChatGPT for code guidance

If you paste this into `README.md`, it will render properly on GitHub — headings, folder tree, and commands will all be formatted neatly.  

If you want, I can also add **GitHub Shields badges** (for React, Node.js, MongoDB, Firebase, etc.) at the top so your demo looks more professional. That would impress interviewers.
